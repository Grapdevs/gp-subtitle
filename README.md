Reason behind this Worpdress plugin:
Tons of plugin are available in the market to add subtitles under pages or post, but all of them have code that 
are not really needed and that directly affect your Wordpress website performance.

This plugin is under developement and soon we will use this plugin to extend the Post and page type features for admin side to public side.
We are really looking for good suggestion and features.
If you have any suggestion kindly let us know.
