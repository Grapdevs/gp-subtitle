As this plugin is open but as owner of plugin, you can contribute but you can not copy the code or can not distribute this code on your name or on another plugin name.

Reason behind this Worpdress plugin:
Tons of plugin are available in the market to add subtitles under pages or post, but all of them have code that 
are not really needed and that directly affect your Wordpress website performance.

GP-Subtitle plugin is useful to add subtitles to pages/posts which show on the front-end. This plugin is minified more then other Subtitle providing plugins.
You can easily manage to allow or disallow subtitles for pages as well as for posts.
<b>Currently working with classic editor, but we are working on it & in the next release you can add subtitles without having/installing a classic editor</b>

We are really looking for good suggestion and features.
