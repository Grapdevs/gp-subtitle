# This plugin is still under development and open to all contributors.
Licence GPLv2 or later 
As this plugin is open but as owner of plugin, you can contrubute but you can not copy the code or can not distribute this code on your name or on another plugin name.

Reason behind this Worpdress plugin:
Tons of plugin are available in the market to add subtitles under pages or post, but all of them have code that 
are not really needed and that directly affect your Wordpress website performance.

This plugin is under developement and soon we will use this plugin to extend the Post and page type features for admin side to public side.
We are really looking for good suggestion and features.
If you have any suggestion kindly let us know.

You can mail your suggestion or can raise the new suggestion using github.
